# Prosper Loan Data Exploration
## by Liudmila Danilovskaya


## Dataset

>There are 113937 loans in the dataset with 81 features for each loan, including borrower's annual percentage rate (APR), status, borrowed amount, debt, etc.  In this project I investigate what features are best in prediction of the borrower interest rate for the loan, borrowers prosper score and credit grade.


## Summary of Findings

> First, I analyzed which factores affect the borrower's interest rate. It turned out that credit grade and prosper score are negatively correlated to the borrower's interest rate. 

>Then I analyzed what influences the borrower's prosper score. The estimated loss is negatively correlated with the prosper score. In addition, higher monthly income and lower debt-to-income ration gives better prosper score.

>And finally, I found how factors affect the borrower's credit grade. The higher available bankcard credit, the higher credit score. The lower bankcard utilization gives the higher credit grade. he smaller number of credit inquiries, the better is credit score. By raising credit score the higher original loan amount can be approved.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> First, histogram plot was created to visualize the distribution of borrower's interest rate. Bar charts were created to visualize the distribution of credit grade and prosper score. 

> Violin plot and point plot were also created to find out that Prosper Score and Credit Grade are negatively correlated to the Borrower's interest rate.

> One more violoin plot was created to find out that estimated loss and prosper score are negatively correlated.

> A series of pointplots was created to find which factors influence most the credit grade and the prosper score.

>Finally, the bar plot was created to show the distribution average original loan amount for each loan status over the 8 years period.
